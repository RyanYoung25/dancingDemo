dancingDemo
===========

This is a demo where hubo listens to a song and does a certain dance depending on the song. 

Dependencies:

-Maestor, For operating hubo (https://github.com/RyanYoung25/maestor)
-Dejavu, For the song fingerprinting and recognition (https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu)

Installation:

Once all of the dependencies are installed the only thing that needs to be done is 
to add the directory that Dejavu was installed in to the PYTHONPATH. This can be done
by adding a line to your .bashrc

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/dejavu
